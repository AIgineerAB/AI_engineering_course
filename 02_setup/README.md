# Setup

If you don't have the packages installed in your virtual environment, use uv to install them for example 

```py
uv pip install pandas ipykernel scikit-learn # more packages ...
```

Remember that you need to activate the environment first 

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate # mac/linux
source .venv/Scripts/activate # windows
```

> [!NOTE]
> if you don't have uv installed use ```pip install uv```
